https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33552810/virtualbox-virtualization-is-enabled-but-not-working

I seach for 2 days and nothing worked for me.. then i find the solution:

The problem is in Windows 10... u need to disable Hyper-V Manager ...

1) make sure in your BIOS cpu virtualization is enable.

2) open your CMD as administrator

3) in your desktop folder type bcdedit and look for hypervisorlaunchtype in the bottom ... if it is Auto or enable we need to disable it !!!!!!

See this picture http://i.stack.imgur.com/m3XFi.png

4) type in your cmd bcdedit /set hypervisorlaunchtype off

5) Restart your OS and be happy !!!

i know this is a old question ... but for everyone who have a similar problem i hope it helps !!
